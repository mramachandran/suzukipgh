            <h3>The Suzuki Method</h3>
            <p>The Suzuki Method, developed by Japanese violinist and educator Shinichi Suzuki, is based on the principle that all children can learn music in the same natural way they learn their native language. Key elements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Early beginning (students can start as young as age 3-4)</li>
                <li>Parent involvement and partnership in the learning process</li>
                <li>Listening to recordings daily</li>
                <li>Constant repetition and review of repertoire</li>
                <li>Learning in a positive, encouraging environment</li>
                <li>Group classes in addition to private lessons</li>
